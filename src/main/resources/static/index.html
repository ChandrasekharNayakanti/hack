				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
					typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
					standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,when an unknown
					printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
					specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
					also the leap into electronic typesetting,remaining essentially
					unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
					Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
					recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
					including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
